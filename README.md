What Is Fake News?
There are two kinds of fake news:
* Stories that aren't true.These are entirely invented stories designed to make people believe something false,
to buy a certain product, or to visit a certain website.
* Stories that have some truth, but aren't 100 percent accurate. 
For example, a journalist quotes only part of what a politician says, giving a false impression of their meaning. 
Again, this can be deliberate, to convince readers of a certain viewpoint, or it can be the result of an innocent mistake.
Either way, it quickly attracts an audience and can become entrenched as an "urban myth."

# Dataset:
This data set consists of 40000 fake and real news. Our goal is to train our model to accurately predict whether a particular piece of news is real or fake.
Fake and real news data are given in two separate data sets, with each data set consisting of approximately 20000 articles.
